# Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis 


## Motivation for the project

I want to analyze some data and try to understand the Seattle Airbnb market from a visitor's perspective.

1. Location: Which neighborhood group would most people pick to stay in?
2. Money: What should I expect about the price range for a 3-day Trip?
3. Airbnb Experience : How did the price of the Airbnb impact customer experience?

## Summary of the analysis

1. If a couple wants to stay in airbnb in Seattle, the most popular areas are Capitol Hill, Downtown or Ballard. 
2. If you are not looking for extremely luxury experience or need to be very economical, you could expect the total price to be in the range of $200 â€” $600 for a 3-day trip.
3. Based on the previous customer reviews, the customers who paid $292-$360 for three days has the highest satisfication because of the accuracy and cleanliness of the place.

# Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis 


## Motivation for the project

```
I want to analyze some data and try to understand the Seattle Airbnb market from a visitor's perspective.
```

## Summary of the analysis

```
If a couple wants to stay in airbnb at popular areas in Seattle, they could choose the areas of Capitol Hill, Downtown or Ballard. 
The neighborhood of Broadway, Belltown and First Hill offers the most Airbnb options with a price range of $192-$858 if the couple wants to stay for 3-day vacation. Based on the previous customer reviews, the customers who paid $292-$360 for three days has the highest satisfication because of the accuracy and cleanliness of the place, paying more than $360 might not worth it.
